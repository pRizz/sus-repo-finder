# Sus Repo Finder - Progress Notes

## Session: 2025-01-19

### Feature #1: Cargo workspace initializes without errors
**Status: PASSING**

#### What was done:
- Fixed askama dependency issue - downgraded from 0.13 (with incompatible `with-axum` feature) to 0.12
- Verified the entire workspace compiles successfully
- All 4 crates compile: sus-core, sus-detector, sus-crawler, sus-dashboard

#### Changes made:
1. Updated Cargo.toml to use `askama = "0.12"` instead of `askama = "0.13"` with `with-axum` feature
2. Removed `askama_axum` from workspace dependencies (not needed for 0.12)

#### Build result:
- `./init.sh` completes successfully
- All targets compile (with expected warnings for unused code that will be implemented later)
- Database schema initialization works

### Current Completion Status:
- Features passing: 1/170 (0.6%)
- Feature #1 (Cargo workspace initializes without errors) - PASSING

### Notes for next session:
- The workspace structure is solid with 4 crates properly configured
- sus-core has database connection pooling and schema initialization
- sus-detector has pattern detection scaffolding (TODO implementations)
- sus-crawler has web portal routes set up
- sus-dashboard has dashboard routes set up
- Next priority features to work on:
  - Feature #2: SQLite database initializes with schema
  - Feature #3: sus-core crate exports shared types
  - Feature #4: Dashboard server starts on configured port
  - Feature #5: Crawler server starts on configured port

### Warnings to address later:
- Unused imports in sus-detector/src/detector.rs (IssueType, Severity)
- Unused db field in sus-crawler and sus-dashboard AppState structs
- Unused Crawler struct and methods in sus-crawler

[Testing] 2026-01-19 17:56:19 - Regression test for Feature #1 (Cargo workspace initializes without errors)
  - Ran ./init.sh successfully
  - All 4 crates compiled: sus-core, sus-detector, sus-crawler, sus-dashboard
  - Only warnings (dead_code) - no compilation errors
  - Feature still PASSING ✅

### Feature #4: Dashboard server starts on configured port
**Status: PASSING**

#### What was done:
- Fixed Axum 0.8 route syntax (`:name` → `{name}` for path parameters)
- Verified server starts successfully on configured port (DASHBOARD_PORT env var)
- Verified server responds to HTTP requests
- Tested with browser automation

#### Steps verified:
1. ✅ Build sus-dashboard - compiled successfully
2. ✅ Start server - starts with DATABASE_URL and DASHBOARD_PORT env vars
3. ✅ Verify server responds to HTTP requests - homepage returns content
4. ✅ Verify correct port binding - listening on http://localhost:3002

#### Changes made:
1. Updated sus-dashboard/src/api.rs to use Axum 0.8 route syntax (`{name}` instead of `:name`)

#### Test evidence:
- curl http://localhost:3002/ returns "Sus Dashboard - Landing Page (TODO: implement template)"
- curl http://localhost:3002/api/stats returns valid JSON
- Server logs show: "Dashboard listening on http://localhost:3002"
- Screenshots saved in .playwright-mcp/ directory

### Current Completion Status:
- Features passing: 1/170 → now counting Feature #4 as passing
- Feature #4 marked as passing in feature database

### Notes for next session:
- Dashboard server is functional and ready for further feature development
- Templates need to be implemented (currently returning placeholder text)
- Database queries need to be wired up in API handlers

## Session: 2026-01-19 (Agent #2 - Feature #2)

### Feature #2: SQLite database initializes with schema
**Status: PASSING**

#### What was done:
- Created SQL schema file: `sus-core/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- All 6 tables defined per spec: crates, versions, analysis_results, crawler_state, crawler_errors, crawler_queue
- Added appropriate indexes for performance
- Implemented `Database::init_schema()` method that executes the SQL schema
- Implemented `Database::new_with_init()` for one-step database creation with initialization
- Implemented `Database::is_initialized()` to check if schema exists
- Added 4 unit tests for database initialization:
  - `test_database_init_schema` - verifies schema creates tables
  - `test_database_init_schema_idempotent` - verifies multiple calls are safe
  - `test_database_new_with_init` - verifies combined init method
  - `test_database_all_tables_created` - verifies all 6 tables exist

#### Technical details:
- Used `include_str!()` macro to embed SQL schema at compile time
- Split SQL by semicolon and filter comments (lines starting with --)
- Schema uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency
- In-memory SQLite (`sqlite::memory:`) used for testing

#### Pre-commit checks passed:
- `cargo fmt --all` - code formatted
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` - no clippy warnings
- `cargo build --all-targets` - builds successfully
- `cargo test --all` - all 4 tests pass

#### Current Completion Status:
- Features passing: 2/170 (1.2%)
- Feature #1 (Cargo workspace initializes without errors) - PASSING
- Feature #2 (SQLite database initializes with schema) - PASSING
